# 'My Baby Log' by James "jimmicorey" Coffelt

## 'My Baby Log' 
is for us mommies & daddies who may be needing a little help keeping track of the VERY FREQUENT tasks of 
feeding, diaper changing, and bathing their newborn babies. With the complete lack of sleep that comes with a newborn, 
as I am learning from current experience, it can be really easy to lose track of when you last did those and how often 
youâ€™ve done them. This app will help with that.

### * Problem: 
"How do I easily keep track of feeding, diaper changing, and bathing my baby... when it's 3 o'clock in the morning and I can barely function?"

### * Solution: 
" 'My Baby Log' ... it's REALLY just as simple as 2-clicks and your done!!!"
